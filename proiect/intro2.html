                    <div class="card-description">
                        <p>We are often fascinated by the culture and civilisation of countries, zone, tribes or lingvistical groups, but we are so accustomed with the culture and civilisation of British, that we believe that is nothing to discover. We believe that we know everything that is possible to know about the British culture. But the thing is that we do not know everything about them.</p>
                        <p>So, I have chosen this subject- “Odd British foods”, because to know British culture is essential to know its traditions and especially its culinary traditions. </p>
                        <p>There are some foods that only the British find delicious and for the rest of us can be really odd, or even disgusting. I have chosen 4 odd foods defining the British culture.</p>
                        <p>I find this subject quite interesting because cultures are never unitary in themselves nor simply dualistic. So what I am attempting here is to define the British culture as a “third cultural space” beyond the equated with the historical identity of culture as a homogenizing unifying force, authenticated by the originary past that is kept alive in the national tradition of the people. Such a third space may open the way to conceptualizing a cultural model based, not on the exoticism of multiculturalism or the diversity of cultures, but on the articulation of cultural hybridity, because it is exactly at the interface of translations, negotiations, interchanges that the meanings of cultures develop.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>During the World Wars of the 20th century difficulties of food supply were countered by official measures, which included rationing. The problem was worse in WWII, and the Ministry of Food was established to address the problems (see Rationing in the United Kingdom). Due to the economic problems following the war, rationing continued for some years, and in some aspects was more strict than during wartime. Rationing was not fully lifted until almost a decade after war ended in Europe, so that a whole generation was raised without access to many previously common ingredients. These policies, put in place by the British government during wartime periods of the 20th century, are often blamed for the decline of British cuisine in the 20th century.</p>
                <p>The last half of the 20th century saw an increase in the availability of a greater range of good quality fresh products and greater willingness by many sections of the British population to vary their diets and select dishes from other cultures such as those of Italy and India.</p>
